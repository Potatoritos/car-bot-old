# car-bot

My old discord bot. New version: https://github.com/Potatoritos/car-bot

To run:

1. run `python setup_cpp_stuff.py build`
2. you will see a folder called `build`. open this folder and find the 2 .so or .dll files, and drag this file into the `carbot` folder
3. in `carbot`, create a copy of `config_copy.py`, and name it `config.py`. Change the values in `config.py`.
4. pip install stuff
5. in `carbot`, run `python carbot.py`
